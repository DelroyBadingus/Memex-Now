### **Did I meet the course goals? **

##### Delroy's commentary:

I think I would definitely say so. For the first tutorial level I completed it confidently enough. When I arrived at the first evaluation of my Memex however, I really 
struggle in simply understanding what was required of me. The struggle included things like "How do I format it?", "What is github for?" among other things I slowly came to understand. By the second evaluation, I was fully happy about how much work I put into the Memex. I made my notes a lot more well composed and organized. I took advantage of many obsidian plugins to make the Memex more interesting and appealing. For the third and final Memex evaluation, I did everything required, including branching out to other classmates' Memexes. I can honestlyh say that because the third evaluation was expected at the start of exam period, it was harder to submit a copy I really liked, but needless to say I made one that was sufficient. In terms of lectures, it was initially difficult to pay attention in the lectures. Part of the reason it was difficult was the environment of the classroom and difficulty with some of the slideshows. I will say that, once I managed to process the lectures better, it was clear that Professor Graham clearly expressed the material in a way he thoroughly enjoyed which allowed me to better understand.
