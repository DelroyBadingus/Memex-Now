### **What is the most powerful thing you've learned in this course?**

##### Delroy's commentary:

Delroy here! Let me be honest and first say it was hard to learn things in this course, but I think simply constructing my memex was the most powerful thing I learned. That's a joke. What I really believe was the most powerful thing I learned was the history of Alan Turing. Again, Turing provided a remarkable amount of brainpower and work in World War 2 and faced a terrible demise just by being gay. Learning about Turing allowed me to understand more about subjects such as Bletchley Park, Bombe, Colossus and computers in general. It's interesting to see how his work shaped what would be future computer created by IBM chips and a million copies of code.
